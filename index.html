          <p>
                I am successful at my current job. But have you heard of the middle-aged crisis? My work has become uninteresting to me. <br />
                I have never liked solving crossword puzzles, but Java Script tasks solving makes me happy. <br />
                Now I am a lecturer at the Institute for Advanced Studies. As a person who has a academic degree and title, I am used to mental work and I know what technical creativity is. I think programming is very close to what I did before.<br />
                Now it’s rather hard to work not in IT and learn IT.
                If I were a junior programmer, I would learn Java Script faster. My academic degree and title support my ability to set goals and achieve them on my own.

          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p> I’ve finished Polatsk State University in 1997 as a civil engineer.
            Than I was postgraduate student. 
            In 2003 I received the degree of Candidate of Technical Sciences in Belarusian National Technical University
            then the rank of assistant professor.

      <div id="English level">
          <h2>English level</h2>
          <p> As a student, I additionally studied English. Classes were held on the textbook Headway.
            At the end of study I learned the upper intermediate level. Updating English knowledge is easier than getting it.
            Now my level is intermediate.<br />
            It is hard to understand native speakers, you know.
